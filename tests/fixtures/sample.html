            <p>A groundbreaking album that defined a generation. OK Computer marks a significant departure from The Bends, and takes Radiohead into more experimental territory. The album's themes of alienation, technological anxiety, and societal disconnection proved remarkably prescient.</p>
            
            <p>Thom Yorke's haunting vocals float over intricate instrumentation, creating a soundscape that feels both personal and universal. From the driving pulse of "Paranoid Android" to the ethereal beauty of "Exit Music (For a Film)," each track contributes to a cohesive artistic statement.</p>
            
            <p>The innovative production techniques pioneered by the band and producer Nigel Godrich would go on to influence countless artists across genres. OK Computer remains a masterpiece that grows more relevant with each passing year.</p>

                    The multi-part suite showcases the band's ambition with its shifting time signatures and moods. Equal parts menacing and beautiful.

                    A deceptively gentle lullaby with devastating lyrics that perfectly captures the album's themes of quiet desperation.
